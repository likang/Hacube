# Hacube

This is a game of Rubik's cube written in Flutter and yes, It's 3D !

## How this come

I am a Flutter fan and I just learned to play Rubik's cube. 
Then I wonder if I can write an app about it in Hack20. 

Flutter has a great graphics library but unluckily it only support 2D. 
I use some matrix transform to simulate the camera change in 3D, 
and manually calculate the depth of every surface of cube.
